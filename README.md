This study investigates the dispersion of gyrotactic particles in upwelling-downwelling oscillatory flows.

We have carried out two types of simulations:
- Lagrangian simulation (runs on Matlab) solves for individual particle trajectories.
- Eulerian simulation (relies on [oomph-lib](https://github.com/oomph-lib/oomph-lib), a finite-element library) solves for the concentration field.

There are two folders, each containing codes for these different descriptions.

Each folder has a separate README file. Check them for further information.
